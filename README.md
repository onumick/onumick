## What I Focus On

- Identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities
- Configuring secure network and endpoint environments
- Automating tasks and analysis with Bash, Python, and Linux
- Delivering cybersecurity training that sticks
- Building scalable, realistic security solutions

## What I'm Working On Now

Right now, I'm gaining hands-on experience through:

- Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges like **Bandit** and **Natas**
- Managing virtual labs using **VMware**
- Preparing for the **Microsoft AZ-500** (Azure Security Engineer Associate)
- Holding **OPSWAT Associate certifications** in data protection and threat prevention
